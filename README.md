# Predictive-Analysis-of-Death-for-known-history-of-Heart-Diseases-
Compared different Classification methods like Logistic Regression, Tree-Based Models with R and Python to analyze the best-suited algorithm and best predictor variables to compare the results with Chicco and Jurman Analysis in 2020 

# Conclusion:
1. Based on the logarithmic regression analysis, the most influential variables in predicting 
heart failure are: Time, Ejection Fraction, and Serum Creatinine.

2. Out of the three models (logistical, tree, and random forest), random forest yielded the 
highest model accuracy.
Logistical : 85%, 
Tree-Based: 80%, 
Random Forest: 89.3%

3. Using a logistical and tree-based model, similar conclusions to Chicco and Jurman (Ref) 
can be found. One major finding of Chicco and Jurman is that gender does not play as 
important role as other studies suggest (Ref) in determining whether the patient dies 
given heart failure. The logistical model and tree-based model also concluded that the 
more influential variables in the model are: age, ejection fraction, serum creatinine, sex, 
and time.
